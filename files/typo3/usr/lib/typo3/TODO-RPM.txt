TODO List for RPM Packages
--------------------------

NOTE: This file contains TODO items related to RPM packaging and
RedHat/SuSE compatibility only. Everything else should go to (be 
looked up at) the TODO.txt in the same directory.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

- superadmin script > point to the default location for TYPO3 sites,
  maybe change the script to include small pieces from each of the 
  typo3-site-* packages???

- something must be done about date and time formats. We have 
  d-m-Y hardcoded in lots of places and jsfunc.evalfield.js is just
  plain wrong about dates as well. I've changed some stuff to use
  U.S. date formats but what'll the other folks do?
